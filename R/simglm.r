#' simglm: A package to simulate and perform power by simulation for 
#'    models based on the generalized linear model.
#'
#' The simglm package provides two categories of important functions:
#' simulation functions and power functions. The package follows a tidy 
#' framework where functions are designed to be similar, do one thing, and 
#' stack on top of each other to build more complex systems.
