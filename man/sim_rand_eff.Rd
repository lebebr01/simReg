\title{Function to simulate random effects.}
\usage{
sim_rand_eff(random.param, cor, n, rand_gen, ther, ther_sim = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{random.param}{Variance of random effects. Must be same length as random.}

\item{cor}{Correlation between random effects.}

\item{n}{Cluster sample size.}

\item{rand_gen}{The generating function used.}

\item{ther}{A vector of length two that specifies the theoretical mean and
standard deviation of the rand_gen. This would commonly be used
to standardize the generating variable to have a mean of 0 and
standard deviation of 1 to meet model assumptions. The variable
is then rescaled to have the variance specified by error_var.}

\item{ther_sim}{A TRUE/FALSE flag indicating whether the error simulation function
should be simulated, that is should the mean and standard deviation
used for standardization be simulated.}

\item{...}{Additional values that need to be passed to the function
called from rand_gen.}

\item{arima}{TRUE/FALSE flag indicating whether residuals should
be correlated. If TRUE, must specify a valid model to pass to
arima.sim, See \code{\link{arima.sim}} for examples.}
}
\description{
Input simulation parameters and returns random effects.
}
\details{
Simulates random effects for the master function \code{\link{sim_reg}} when
simulating a linear mixed model, both cross sectional and longitudinal.  Allows
the ability to simulate random effects from a Laplace, chi-square (1), mixture
normal, or normal distribution.
