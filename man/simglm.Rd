\title{simglm: A package to simulate and perform power by simulation for 
   models based on the generalized linear model.}
\usage{
simglm(sim_args)
}
\arguments{
\item{sim_args}{A named list with special model formula syntax. See details and examples
for more information. The named list may contain the following:
\itemize{
  \item fixed: This is the fixed portion of the model (i.e. covariates)
  \item random: This is the random portion of the model (i.e. random effects)
  \item error: This is the error (i.e. residual term).
}}
}
\description{
The simglm package provides two categories of important functions:
simulation functions and power functions. The package follows a tidy 
framework where functions are designed to be similar, do one thing, and 
stack on top of each other to build more complex systems.
#'

This function is most useful to pass to \code{\link{replicate_simulation}}.
  The function attempts to determine automatically which aspects to add to 
  the simulation/power generation based on the elements found in the sim_args
  argument.
